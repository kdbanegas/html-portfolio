<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As an Account Executive at Red Hawk Technologies, I help clients achieve their
  software development needs, from custom software support and maintenance to
  web and mobile app development. I leverage my sales engineering certification
  and my experience as a business coach to provide tailored solutions that
  optimize client satisfaction and revenue generation.

  Before joining Red Hawk, I ran my own business coaching service, specializing
  in online fitness brands. I collaborated with business owners to implement
  CRMs and technical tools, such as Monday.com, for streamlined team management
  and business solutions. I also generated increased business sales through
  innovative social media strategies, achieving consistent $10k+ monthly revenue
  growth for my clients.

<p>
  I am passionate about helping entrepreneurs and professionals grow their
  businesses and careers, and I share my insights and tips on sales and lead
  generation on my podcast. I have strong communication, team building, and goal
  orientation skills, and I am fluent in Spanish. I am always eager to learn new
  things and stay updated with the latest trends.
